# UberPage
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/StegSchreck/uberpage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/StegSchreck/uberpage)

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/StegSchreck/uberpage.svg?logo=github)](https://github.com/StegSchreck/uberpage/releases)

A simple webpage for displaying a collection of links. Each link can have an optional background image, link text, or icon. The layout of the links will be generated automatically, depending on the number of links to be displayed.

## How to Use
* Fill `data.json` with your items. See about possible configuration in the next paragraph.
* Put the necessary images in appropriate quality at `public/img`. Reference them in the `data.json` by filename only, not including the path.
* Deploy on somewhere. I've included a guide for hosting it on AWS.
* Done.

### Possible Configuration Values for an Item
```javascript
    export default {
      "items": [
        {
          "link": "https://github.com/StegSchreck",
          "description": "My open source projects on GitHub", // optional
          "text_color": "#ffffff", // defaults to '#4A86E8' - affects both title and description (if set)
          "background_logo": "GitHub_white.png", // optional
          "background_logo_size": "70%", // defaults to '50%'
          "background_picture": "cover.jpg", // optional
          "background_picture_size": "cover", // defaults to 'cover'
          "background_color": "#000000" // defaults to '#282c34'
        }
        // ...
      ]
    }
```

The effect of the background configuration values is as follows (from top to bottom):
* `title` (or `description` on hover)
* `background_logo`
* `background_picture`
* `background_color`

This means if both `background_logo` and `background_picture` are set, that the logo will cover parts of the picture.
Additionally, if a `title` is set, it with have a darkening effect on whatever is underneath to make it more readable.

### Deployment to Production

## Why this Name?
Obviously there is no connection to any mobility provider. The word "uber" is taken from the German word "Ã¼ber", meaning "over", "above" or "on top". As this project is meant to act as an overview page for multiple other pages via linking, this name can be taken literally.
